<div id="intro">
    Bananas are one of the earliest cultivated fruits.
    They were originally found in South East Asia, mainly in India around the 3<sup>rd</sup> century B.C. 
    To this day, it is one of the most consumed fruits worldwide, with a retail value estimated above $20 billion USD in 2016.
    In this presentation, we will explore the banana market and how it has evolved over time.
    We fill first look at banana import-export balance. Then, we will use this information to understand how banana 
    resources are consumed. Finally, we will highlight how this information correlates with the unitary price.

            <h2>
                What does the global banana trade look like?
            </h2>
            Let's start our exploratory analysis by looking at the flow of banana imports and exports. Where do the world's 
            bananas come from? Where are they sent for consumption? What does this flow look like over time?
            <br></br>
            Explore the map to the side! Move the slider at the top to see an overview of the banana trade across time, 
            or click on a country to view that country's banana trade balance over time. Note that the values represent 
            net exports, so negative values indicate that the country has a net import of bananas.
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Most of the world's bananas come from South and Central America.
            </h3>
            While a large number of banana exports are from the Philippines, the majority of bananas come from the Americas.
            <b>Ecuador alone exported 6.6 million tonnes of bananas in 2019!</b> For context, the next top 4 banana exporting countries 
            (the Philippines, Costa Rica, Columbia, and Guatemala) each exported 1-3 million tonnes in 2019.
            <br></br>
            Something to note that we can't see on this map is that <b>India is actually by far the world's largest producer of bananas, 
            with an output of 30.5 million tonnes!</b> However, the vast majority of this is consumed within the country, and only about 
            173,000 bananas are exported from India. However, if we click on India on the map, we can see that their banana exports have
            been spiking in recent years.
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Europe and populous countries dominate banana imports.
            </h3>
            Banana imports are much more spread out around the world than exports. Generally, though, Europe and large, populous countries
            hold a large proportion of the worlds imports. <b>The U.S. is by far the largest importer of bananas, importing over 4 million
            tonnes in 2019.</b> China, Russia, Japan, and Germany, in that order, were the next largest importers of bananas in 2019, with
            each importing 1-2 million tonnes. 
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                The banana market has been growing over time.
            </h3>
            The banana market has been growing! Exporters have been exporting more bananas and importers have been importing more. We can
            see this in the map to the right; as you drag the slider from left to right, the map gets "darker."
            <br></br>
            The dynamics of a few countries are worth noting. The U.S. has always been at the top of the world's banana importers. It has
            been importing over 1 million tonnes of bananas every year since 1961! China also has an interesting relationship with
            the banana market. In the 1960s, they were a relatively large <i>exporter</i> of bananas, but in the 1990s, it switched to 
            being a net <i>importer</i>. In 2019, it was the second largest importer of bananas.

            <h2>
                What does banana consumption look like?
            </h2>
            After seeing the banana trade balance, we decide to take a look at their consumption. We want to understand 
            the main drivers of consumption and their distribution, and also look at a country-level breakdown.  
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Net consumption of bananas is growing too!
            </h3>
            The stacked bar chart displays the net consumption of bananas in tonnes worldwide; banana consumption was around 
            <b>120,000,000</b> tonnes per year worldwide. In each year, it is further broken into the five most common categories: 
            food supply, export quantity, loss, processed products, and feed (for animals). Some other categories that are omitted are tourist 
            consumption, other uses (non-food), and residuals, which are all insignificant numbers compared to the five main categories. 
            <br></br>
            There is an <b>upward trend</b> in total banana consumption worldwide, with an exception in 2016, due to lower food supply and 
            export quantity that year. The proportions of the five consumption categories stayed similar throughout the observed time period.
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Small countries tend to consume the most bananas per capita!
            </h3>

            Another dimension of information is at country level, where in each year and for each category, the <b>top 5</b> countries are 
            listed with their consumption level of bananas in tonnes per one thousand population. The map is an auxiliary tool that 
            helps to locate those top 5 countries. Many of the countries that consume the most bananas per capita are quite small.
            For example, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a small southern Caribbean nation, but it feeds <b>more than 400 tonnes</b> 
            of bananas per one thousand people to animals! Due to its mountainous terrain, Saint Vincent is less of a sugar-producing 
            center than other Caribbean islands but very suitable for banana growing.
            
            <h3>
                The top 5 banana consuming countries have been consistent.
            </h3>
            Costa Rica, Ecuador, Belize, and Guatemala were very consistently exporting bananas as expected from the above map. Belgium came 
            in the race since 2016, which at first seems weird because of its location. It turns out that Belgium is the 
            biggest re-exporter of bananas!
            <br></br>
            The top 5 countries for food supply category have always been Papua New Guinea, Laos, Samoa, Dominica, Rwanda. Calculated 
            from our data, <b>in Papua New Guinea, each person consumed 2~3 bananas per day</b>.

            <h2>
                Finally, let's look at how the unitary price relates to consumption.
            </h2>
            We expect countries with a high demand and low supply of bananas to have higher prices. Let's see if we can determine if 
            this is the case.
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Consumption correlates strongly with the population of the country.
            </h3>
            <b>Consumer markets correlate naturaly with the country population.</b>
            Indonesia, Brazil and The United States are the main consumers of bananas.
            Pakistan (bottom left corner) has also a fairly large population (221 million), but it is relatively poorer. 
            It consumes a lot less bananas than the other large countries.
            Pakistan exports some banana but the raw value of around 200,000 tonnes per year is fairly small for a country of that
            population size. This drives the consumption down. 
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Prices can be <b>quite volatile</b>.
            </h3>
            Four years of data are available in this visualization.
            It can be noted that the smaller the country, the more volatile prices 
            tend to be. 

            Algeria is a relevant example in this regard, where the price skyrockets in 2016 and 2017. Kenya also has a very high unitary price in 2015.
            As the price went down, the consumption went up from <b>from 1.09 kg per capita to 1.2</b>

            Additionally, we can note that Scandanavian countries have a high price but it remains constant throughout the years.
            
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Consumption by richer countries is stable throughout the years.
            </h3>
            Even wealthy countries such as Canada and Australia can suffer from volatile prices.
            They can withstand price variation more easily. <b>The United States, Canada and Australia</b> maintain constant levels of consumption, despite price variation.
            Poorer countries are set to be more sensitive to the food market than rich countries. Indonesia has a lot more variance in its consumption.
            This is of course influenced by the price of bananas themselves but also by overall weaker and more unequal economy. 
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Additional information
            </h3>
            India was not displayed on this graphic as its consumption is an order of magnitude above the other countries.
            China didn't provide data.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<div id="conclusion">
    We hope we've convinced you that the banana market is quite interesting. In our first visualization, we showed the growing world 
    banana trade. In our second visualization, we explored the how this supply is being used, and finally we see how these 
    dyanics translate to the prices we pay for bananas.
    <br></br>
    We hope that this presentation has whet your appetite for bananas, and next time you bite into one, we hope you think about
    where it came from. Thanks for reading!
