<div id="intro">
    Bananas are one of the earliest fruits cultivated.
    They were originally found in South East Asia, mainly in India around 3 centuries B.C. 
    To this day, they are one of the most consumed fruit worldwide, with a retail value estimated above 20 billion USD in 2016.
    In this presentation, we will try to highlight how banana import-export balance and retail price can be viewed as an unconventional yet powerful economic indicator.
    we fill first look at banana import-export balance.
    Then, we will use this information to understand how banana ressources are allocated per countries.
    Finally, we will use our custom dataset to highlight how those information correlates with the unitary price.

                What does the global banana trade look like?
            </h2>
            Let's start our exploratory analysis by looking at the flow of banana imports and exports. Where do the world's 
            bananas come from? Where are they sent for consumption? What does this flow look like over time?
            <br></br>
            Explore the map to the side! Move the slider at the top to see an overview of the banana trade across time, 
            or click on a country to view that country's banana trade balance over time. Note that the values represent 
            net exports, so negative values mean that the country has a net import of bananas.
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Most of the world's bananas come from South and Central America.
            </h3>
            Most of the world's bananas come from South and Central America, with a large number also coming from the Philippines. 
            <b>Ecuador alone exported 6.6 million tonnes of bananas in 2019!</b> For context, the next top 4 banana exporting countries 
            (the Philippines, Costa Rica, Columbia, and Guatemala) each exported 1-3 million tonnes in 2019.
            <br></br>
            Something to note that we can't see on this map is that <b>India is actually by far the world's largest producer of bananas, 
            with an output of 30.5 million tonnes!</b> However, the vast majority of this is consumed within the country, and only about 
            173,000 bananas are exported from India. However, if we click on India on the map, we can see that their banana exports have
            been spiking in recent years.
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Europe and populous countries dominate banana imports.
            </h3>
            Banana imports are much more spread out around the world than export. Generally, though, Europe and large, populous countries
            hold a large proportion of the worlds imports. <b>The U.S. is by far the largest importer of bananas, importing over 4 million
            tonnes in 2019.</b> China, Russia, Japan, and Germany, in that order, were the next largest importers of bananas in 2019, with
            each importing 1-2 million tonnes. 
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                The banana market has been growing over time.
            </h3>
            The banana market has been growing! Exporters have been exporting more bananas and importers have been importing more. We can
            see this in the map to the right; as you drag the slider from left to right, the map gets "darker."
            <br></br>
            The dynamics of a few countries are worth noting. The U.S. has always been at the top of the world's banana importers. It has
            been importing over 1 million tonnes of bananas every year since 1961! China also have an interesting relationship with
            the banana market. In the 1960s, they were a relatively large <i>exporter</i> of bananas, but in the 1990s, it switched to 
            being a net <i>importer</i>. In 2019, it was the second largest importer of bananas

    <b>After seeing the layout for banana trade balance, we then take a look at the consumption side of bananas. We want to 
        understand the main means of consumption and their distribution, and also look at a country-level breakdown as in the 
        first visualization.</b>

            <h3>
                Net Consumption of Bananas
            </h3>
            The stacked bar chart displays the Net Consumption of bananas in tonnes worldwide, and banana consumption was around 
            <b>120,000,000</b> tonnes per year worldwide. In each year, it is further broken into the five most common categories: 
            food supply, export quantity, loss, processed, feed (to animals). Some other categories that are omitted are tourist 
            consumption, other uses (non-food), and residuals, which are all insignificant numbers compared to the five main categories. 
            <br></br>
            There is an <b>upward trend</b> in total banana consumption worldwide, with an exception in 2016, due to lower Food Supply and 
            Export Quantity that year. And the proportions of the five consumption categories stay similar throughout. 
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Which countries are consuming the most? 
            </h3>
            Another dimension of information is at country level, where in each year and for each category, the <b>top 5</b> countries are 
            listed with their consumption level of bananas in tonnes per one thousand population. The map is an auxiliary tool that 
            helps to locate those top 5 countries in the world. Some countries are too small that won't even show up on the map, 
            for example, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a small southern Caribbean nation, but it feeds <b>more than 400 tonnes</b> 
            of bananas to animals per one thousand people there! Costa Rica, Ecuador, Belize, and Guatemala were very consistently exporting 
            bananas as expected, and they are all near the equator on the map. Belgium came in the race since 2016, but as the biggest re-export 
            country. The top 5 countries for food supply category have always been Papua New Guinea, Laos, Samoa, Dominica, Rwanda. Calculated 
            from our data, <b>in Papua New Guinea, each person consumed 2~3 bananas per day</b>.

            A good economic indicator has to provide relevant information to the price of the item of interest.

        <div>
            <h3>
                Consumption correlates strongly with the population of the country.
            </h3>
            <b>Consumer markets correlate naturaly with the country population.</b>
            Indonesia, Brazil and The United States are the main consumers of bananas.
            Pakistan has also a fairly large population (221 million), but it is relatively poorer. 
            It consumes a lot less bananas than the other large countries.
            Pakistan exports some banana but the raw value of around 200,000 tonnes a year is fairly small for a country that size.
            This drives the consumption down.
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Prices can be <b>very volatile</b>.
            </h3>
            Four years are available in this visualization.
            It can be noted that the smaller the country the more volatile prices 
            tend to be. 

            Algeria is a relevant example to this regard, where the price skyrockets in 2016 and 2017. Kenya also has a very high unitary price in 2015.
            As the price went down, the consumption went up from <b>from 1.09 kg per capita to 1.2</b>

            Additionally, we can note that scandanavian countries present high price but it remains constant throughout the years.
            
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Rich countries consumption is stable throughout the years.
            </h3>
            Even wealthy countries such as Canada and Australia can suffer from volatile prices.
            They can tank price variation more easily. <b>The United States, Canada and Australia</b> maintain constant levels of consumption, despite price variation.
            Poorer countries are set to be more dependant on the food market that rich countries. Indonesia has a lot more variance in it's consumption.
            This is of course influenced by the price of bananas themselves but also by overall weaker and more unequal economy.

            India was not displayed on this graphic as its consumption is an order of magnitude above the other countries.
            China didn't provide data.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<div id="conclusion">
    Bananas make for a very powerful economic indicator. They are consumed worldwide, in very different quantities and are subject to economic worldwide dynamics (Inflation, globalization, etc).
    They provide a unique way to analyze accelarating dynamics as we have shown that the 
    import-export balance of most countries tend to exacerbate (Exporters become larger exporters and vis-versa). 
    However bananas is a more informative economic indicator than the traditional big mac index from The Economist.
    Indeed in the second visualization, we showed that poorer countries are more likely to allocate their bananas supply to food consumption,
    wether it is produced or imported. The value of bananas as an economic indicator war further demonstrated in the third visualization. We showed that smaller and poorer
    countries are more vulnerable to market fluctuations, while their wealthier counterparts can maintain the same level of consumption despite price variation.

    We hope that this presentation has fueled your interest in understanding bananas as an unconventional but relevant economic indicator.
    Thanks for reading !
